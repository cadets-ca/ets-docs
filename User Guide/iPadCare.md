# iPad Care

## Temperature Limits

The iPad will go to sleep if Temperature >35˚C.

This can occur at ambient temperature as low at 25˚C if the screen is left open in direct sun for too long
Do not store below -20˚C to avoid battery damage (go with -10˚C to be on the safe side).

Don’t let it get wet.

## Battery Care

Turn the screen off using the ‘lock button’ when the iPad is not in use to ensure the battery lasts all day.

To maintain a healthy battery, use it for at least 10 hours per month (ie. One complete charge cycle), even in the off season. That said, the batteries are only designed for 1000 recharging cycles, so don’t overuse it.
